= Sexy CSS3 Flashes
These CSS3 flashes were created on the grounds of providing better functionality and visual appeal. They look best in WebKit-based browsers, almost as good in Firefox, with all other browsers degrading rather gracefully. If you use these flashes in the wild, drop me a note and let me know. http://twitter.com/phillapier

*Slide-down animation is being served by jQuery (required).

*I recommend using Sass with these flashes. (http://sass-lang.com)
